K9copy-reloaded is a continuation of the original k9copy program.
It allows you to make 1:1 backups of both single-and dual-layer
DVDs, as well as compress a dual-layer DVD to single-layer.

NOTE 1: For some reason, this will not build properly if ccache is
enabled.  (It will build and run, but the backups come out corrupted.)

NOTE 2: This script builds an internal copy of the ffmpeg 2.8.15
static libaries.  It has been tested and does not (should not?)
interfere with any existing ffmpeg installation.  Just remember that
you need to be in a full shell (su - and not just su) for ffmpeg
to build properly.

NOTE 3: K9copy-reloaded is unable to open .iso files on 32-bit systems.
This is an issue with libdvdread and not with k9copy-reloaded.
They open just fine on 64-bit systems.

NOTE 4: If you wish to build this on current (15.0 EXPERIMENTAL), you
will need to build and install the gcc5 package from ponce's -current
SBo repo, then pass CURRENT=yes to the script.

NOTE 5: This program is only intended for personal backups, and is NOT
intended for copying of copyrighted commercial DVDs.  Therefore, there 
is NO CSS decription libary included in this package.

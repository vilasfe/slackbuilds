A cross platform BSON Library for C

libbson builds, parses, and iterates BSON documents, the native data
format of MongoDB. It also converts BSON to and from JSON, and provides
a platform compatibility layer for the MongoDB C Driver.

libbson conflicts with mongo-c-driver.

To build the libbson documentation, install Sphinx and set
DOCS=yes

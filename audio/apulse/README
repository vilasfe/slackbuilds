PulseAudio emulation for ALSA.

The program provides an alternative partial implementation of the
PulseAudio API. It consists of a loader script and a number of
shared libraries with the same names as from original PulseAudio,
so applications could dynamically load them and think they are
talking to PulseAudio. Internally, no separate sound mixing daemon is
used. Instead, apulse relies on ALSA's dmix, dsnoop, and plug plugins
to handle multiple sound sources and capture streams running at the
same time. dmix plugin muxes multiple playback streams; dsnoop plugin
allow multiple applications to capture from a single microphone;
and plug plugin transparently converts audio between various sample
formats, sample rates and channel numbers.  For more than a decade now,
ALSA comes with these plugins enabled and configured by default. Cmake
is required to build it.

Note: It's recommended to uninstall PulseAudio before install apulse.

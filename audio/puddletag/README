Puddletag is a audio tag editor for GNU/Linux similar to the Windows
program Mp3tag. Unlike most taggers for GNU/Linux, it uses a
spreadsheet-like layout so that all the tags you want to edit by hand
are visible and easily editable.

Optional, but recommended packages are: gst0-ffmpeg, gst0-plugins-bad,
gst0-plugins-ugly, gst0-python, quodlibet, and chromaprint.

NOTE: configobj and mutagen need to be built with python3 support. They
will automatically provide python3 modules if the SlackBuild is ran
with python3 installed.

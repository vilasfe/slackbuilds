Tauon music box is a modern streamlined music player with a minimal
interface that's packed with features! An emphasis on playlists and
direct file importing puts you in control of your music collection.
Uses GStreamer for playback.

Special thanks to Reza Talebi who helped me for porting this player to
Slackware.

mpd (Music Player Daemon)

Music Player Daemon (MPD) allows remote access for playing music (MP3,
Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, AAC, Mod, MIDI, and wave files) and managing
playlists.  MPD is designed for integrating a computer into a stereo
system that provides control for music playback over a local network. It
also makes a great desktop music player, especially if you are a console
junkie, like frontend options, or restart X often.

ViewVC is a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control
repositories. It generates templatized HTML to present navigable
directory, revision, and change log listings. It can display specific
versions of files as well as diffs between those versions.

Installing Pygments (available on SlackBuilds) will improve your ViewVC
experience (highlighting changes)

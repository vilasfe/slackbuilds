Gambas is a free IDE based on a Basic interpreter with object
extensions, a bit like Visual Basic. With Gambas, you can quickly
design your program GUI with Qt5, Qt4 or GTK+, access MySQL, PostgreSQL,
ODBC and SQLite databases, pilot applications with D-Bus, translate
your program into any language, create network applications easily,
make 3D OpenGL applications, make CGI web applications, and so on.

alure, gtkglext, imlib2, unixODBC, sqlite2, postgresql, SDL2_image,
SDL2_ttf, SDL2_mixer, translate-shell and qt5-webkit are optional
dependencies.

Note: You should uninstall any present version of gambas before
creating this package. To enable JIT please install llvm from extra.

The Gambas ide can create slackware packages of your gambas programs,
but bear in mind that the install location is fixed as /usr/bin

note: installing llvm from slackware/extra is recommended.

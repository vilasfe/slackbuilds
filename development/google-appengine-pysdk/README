google-appengine-pysdk (Google Appengine Python SDK)

The Python SDK includes a web server application that simulates the
App Engine environment, including a local version of the datastore,
Google Accounts, and the ability to fetch URLs and send email directly
from your computer using the App Engine APIs. The Python SDK runs on
any computer with Python 2.5 or 2.7, and versions are available for
Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. (The Python SDK is not compatible with
Python 3).

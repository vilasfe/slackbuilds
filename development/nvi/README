Nvi is an implementation of the ex/vi text editor.

Nvi supports all the historic ex/vi features except for open mode
and the lisp edit option (it has a fully implemented underlying ex
mode). Some additional features are: extended regular expressions,
infinite undo, and multiple edit buffers.  Nvi has a very small memory
footprint.

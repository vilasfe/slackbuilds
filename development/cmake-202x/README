cmake-202x (cross-platform, open-source make system)

CMake is used to control the software process using simple platform
and compiler independent configuration files. CMake generates
native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the
compiler environment of your choice.

This version of cmake is much newer than the version included in
Slackware 14.2. It installs to /opt, so it won't conflict with the
OS-provided cmake package.

See README_SBo.txt for directions on using this version of cmake with
your own SlackBuild scripts, or to develop/maintain software that
needs a newer cmake.

cc65 (6502 cross compiler suite)

cc65 is a complete cross development package for 65(C)02 systems,
including a powerful macro assembler, a C compiler, linker, librarian
and several other tools.

Supported targets include the Atari 400/800/XL/XE computers, the Atari
Lynx console, the Commodore PET/VIC/64/16/Plus4, the Nintendo NES, the
Apple II, and others.

The cc65 project rarely does releases. This build is updated once or
twice a year, to the latest git. If you need a specific version of
cc65, see README_SBo.txt.

tinyirc (tiny IRC client)

A very small, stripped down IRC client. It doesn't have most of the
more advanced commands in the ircII family of IRC clients, nor does
it have any color, but it works, and it's tiny. It's a bare bones
IRC client which has no editing capabilities other than backspace to
correct typing.

This SlackBuild sets the default IRC server to chat.freenode.org, when
tinyirc is run without a server argument.

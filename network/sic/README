sic (simple irc client)

sic is an extremely simple IRC client. It consists of less than 250
lines of code.

The default host is "irc.oftc.net" and the default port is 6667. You
can change these by setting IRCHOST and/or IRCPORT in the script's
environment, e.g.:

# IRCHOST=chat.freenode.org IRCPORT=6668 ./sic.SlackBuild

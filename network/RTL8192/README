The RTL8192 package includes the kernel module '8192eu',
which contains a TP-Link-provided kernel driver known to
support the Realtek 8192 chipset, and possibly others.

Slackware kernel-source package needs to be installed for build to work,
and module will need to be re-built after a kernel upgrade.

To build for a kernel other than the one currently running,
pass KVER variable when invoking SlackBuild script.  E.g.,

   KVER=4.4.14 ./RTL8192.SlackBuild

This driver is advertised to work with the following TP-Link USB wifi
adapters: TL-WN821N V6/TL-WN822N V5/TL-WN823N V3.  The driver has
also been tested (both i386 & x86_64) to work for the TL-WN823N V2.
Other brands of USB devices utilizing the Realtek 8192 chip may work,
as well.

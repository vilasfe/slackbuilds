OpenERP is a free enterprise management software package. It covers all
domains for small to medium businesses; accounting, stock management,
sales, customer relationship, purchases, project management, etcetera.
This is the client application.

Note that you will get an error on startup if matplotlib is not
installed, but the only functionality lost is presenting graphs.

# nvidia-switch utility 4.7.2
#
# A tool to install and cleanly remove the nvidia driver without stomping
# on the mesa files.  Note: this tool "should" allow switching on the fly,
# but why? Pick a driver! You will stilll need to edit a bunch of other
# config files.

# When ROOT=<PATH> is specified when using {install,upgrade,remove}pkg,
# PATH is usually specified without a trailing "/", so we need to add it

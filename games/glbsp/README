glBSP is a node builder specially designed for OpenGL ports of the
DOOM game engine.  It adheres to the "GL-Nodes Specification", which
means it adds some new special lumps to a WAD file that makes it easy
and fast for an OpenGL DOOM engine to compute the polygons needed for
drawing the levels.

There are many DOOM ports that understand the GL-Nodes which glBSP
creates, including: EDGE, the Doomsday engine (JDOOM), PrBoom, Legacy
2.0, Vavoom, Doom3D and ZDoomGL.

This script builds both the command-line (glbsp) and GUI (glBSPX)
binaries of glBSP.  If you don't need the GUI and/or don't want to
install fltk, "export OMIT_GUI=yes" in the build script's environment.

The package also includes a C header and a library (what would be
known as libglbsp-dev on other Linux distributions).  By default, a
dynamic library is created.  This works on x86 and x86_64 systems, but
is untested on others.  If you have trouble with the shared library,
"export STATIC=yes" in the build script's environment (and please
contact the maintainer of this SlackBuild!)

flite (speech synthesis engine)

Flite is a small, fast run-time synthesis engine, designed for
embedded systems and servers. Flite was developed by Alan W. Black and
Kevin Lenzo at Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh.

Starting with version 2.0.0, flite is able to load extra voice files
at runtime, in its own .flitevox format. If you want to include
loadable voices in the package, download the ones you want from
http://festvox.org/flite/packed/flite-2.0/voices/ and place them
in the same directory as the SlackBuild. They will be installed in
/usr/share/flite/, and can be used with the flite's -voice option.

The flite API documentation is available as a GNU info document,
via "info flite". The same docs are available as HTML in
/usr/doc/flite-$VERSION/html if you have texi2html installed from SBo.

The API docs are only needed for developers who intend to write code that
uses flite as a library. If you have build errors that mention texi2html,
try 'export HTML=no' in the script's environment.

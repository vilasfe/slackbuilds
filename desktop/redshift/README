redshift (screen colour adjuster)

Redshift adjusts the colour temperature of your screen according to
your surroundings. This may help your eyes if you are working in front
of the screen at night.

This package has a dependency on geoclue2, however it will compile the
package without it if geoclue2 is not present.

This package will build against python3 for the gui if python3 is
available.  If not, we use the fedora patch to build the gui with
python2. If you want to compile using python3 on 14.2, you will need
the pyxdg and pygobject3-python3 packages from SBo.

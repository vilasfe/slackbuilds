Gridcoin is an open source cryptocurrency (Ticker: GRC) which securely
rewards volunteer computing performed on the BOINC platform. BOINC is
an open source volunteer computing grid which combines the processing
power of individual users for the purposes of scientific research.

QT5, qrencode and miniupnpc are optional (available on SBo) to build
GUI, QR and UPnP support. QT5 will be detected automatically, for the
others, run script as

QRENC=yes ./Gridcoin-Research.SlackBuild
UPNP=yes ./Gridcoin-Research.SlackBuild

You will need to edit the configuration file gridcoinresearch.conf
in /etc/Gridcoin-Research/ and place it in your home directory
~/.GridcoinResearch/ to provide the location of your boinc data
and any other configurations that you require. For details, see

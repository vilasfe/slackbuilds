BibleTime is a Bible study application for Linux.  It is based on the K
Desktop Environment and uses the Sword programming library to work with
Bible texts, commentaries, dictionaries, and books provided by the 
Crosswire Bible Society.

This version requires sword version 1.8.1 or higher, and qt5.9 or
higher, as well as po4a and fop, as the documentation is created in the
build now.

If you have a local version of cmake>=3.10 then setting CMAKEBINDIR
to the directory containing your local cmake binary will allow that to
be used instead of the version bundled in this script. It will save
several minutes of build time.

Vulkan supports multiple GPUs and multiple global contexts (VkInstance).
The ICD loader is necessary to support multiple GPUs and the VkInstance
level Vulkan commands. Additionally, the loader manages inserting Vulkan
layer libraries, including validation layers between the application and
the ICD.

qt5 is an optional dependency for vkconfig.

This will not provide a vulkan driver which must be acquired elsewhere.

This SlackBuild will compile vulkan-sdk from source.
